            <h2>Today Is “National Take Your Dog to Work Day”</h2>
            <p>If you’re lucky enough to work from home, every day is “Take Your Dog to <br>
             Work Day.”  But most people aren’t, so today is the one day a year that many <br>
            companies allow their employees to bring their pups with them.  Some <br>
            workplaces are so fantastic that dogs are welcome all year round!While it’s <br>
            obviously not recommended for dogs to be brought to work sites that are <br>
             dangerous for them or where they’ll get in the way, such as an operatin <br>
             brroom or a factory floor, offices can be the perfect environment for pets.

            <h2>The future of Amazon drone deliveries</h2>
            <p>Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has filed for a patent for beehive-like towers that <br>
            would serve as multi-level fulfillment centers for its delivery drones to take off <br>
            and land. The facilities would be built vertically to blend in with high rises in <br>
           urban areas. Amazon envisions each city would have one.
            The patent <br>
            application, filed in December 2015 and published on Thursday by the U.S. <br>
            Patent and Trademark Office, features several drawings of these buildings,<br>
           such as the beehive, a cylinder-shaped center and one that looks like a UFO</p>

            <h2>Japanese foods we love-Sushi</h2>
            <p>Without a doubt, sushi is one of Japan's greatest gastronomical gifts to the <br>
                 world. Almost poetic in its simplicity, good sushi relies on two things: the <br>
                  freshness of the ingredients and the knife skills of the chef.
                Whether you like <br>
                 your raw fish draped over bite-sized balls of vinegared rice, rolled up in <br>
                  toasted nori seaweed or pressed into fat rectangular logs, delicious sushi can <br
                  > be found in every price range.The sushi at Sushisho Masa in Roppongi  is <br>
                   nothing short of perfection.  At around ¥20,000 ($200) per person, it's a <br>
                    splurge, but perfection doesn't come cheap.

            <h2>New York City's best rooftop bars</h2>
            <p>There's something about being far above the hubbub of the Big Apple's <br>
            streets, especially in the summertime, when humidity levels soar and the <br>
            concrete feels like it's emanating heat waves.
            "Being on a New York City <br>
            rooftop gives you this special pleasure of feeling part of the city,
            inside it, but <br>
           at a distance," says Ray Chung, director of design at The Johnson Studio, <br>
            the firm behind the rooftop lounge at The Wit Hotel in Chicago, among other <br>
             projects."Walking down the streets is one thing, but being able to let your <br>
              guard down and see the city reduced in size -- all the <br>
               while still breathing the same air and still hearing the buzz of the city -- it can be intoxicating," says <br>
                Chung.</p>

            <p>Gaggan was sitting in a Singapore ballroom attending the Asia's 50 Best <br>
             Restaurant Awards, waiting in agony to find out whether his eponymous <br>
              Bangkok-based restaurant could hold onto the number three spot it grabbed <br>
               last year "As they got to five, then four, and my name hadn't been called, I <br>
                thought 'that means I'm three again ... at least we matched our success, at <br>

                  two and I still hadn't been called up, I thought 'If I'm number one, I'll try not to <br>

            <h2>The best things to do and see in Newport</h2>
            <p> Many of those cliches about postcard-pretty coastal New England towns got <br>
            their start in the same place: Newport, Rhode Island.The town is best known <br>
          for being a summer getaway for America's aristocracy during the Gilded Age, <br>
            with wealthy families like the Vanderbilts, the Dukes and Astors all owning <br>
             summer homes there (they say "cottage," we say "ginormous mansion") and <br>
              throwing glamorous parties.Although more of the luxurious estates are <br>
               museums than homes these days, Newport hasn't lost its seaside charm <br>
                -- especially in the summer. Here's our guide to the best things to do, eat and <br>
                 explore both indoors and out.</p>

            <p>Just minutes before the Humane Society Shelter in Bangor, Maine closed for <br>
             the day on Tuesday, they only had one lone puppy left who had yet to be <br>
              adopted.  Not to worry however, that puppy too found a great forever home, <br>
               marking the end of an amazing campaign to save some dogs on death row <br>
                from a high-kill shelter in the southern United States.Ada Webb was the lucky <br>
                 person to adopt that final dog.  Webb had been in line there for quite some <br>
                  time waiting to adopt, hoping to be able to surprise her nine-year-old son with <br>
                   a new, four-legged furry family member.  </p>

            <p>With nearly 2 billion people around the world checking in monthly, it makes <br>
             sense that Facebook is dealing with some very sticky issues. The social <br>
              network is facing increasing pressure to address them head on.
            He's shifting <br>
